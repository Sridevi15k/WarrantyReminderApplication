    Usually most of us wouldn't track the warranty that comes with the products we buy. When it is time to replace the product for any defects in materials or workmanship or functioning, we don't remember if we have registered the product or we wouldn't be sure if there is still warranty time left. We need to put in a lot of money to get a new one when we don't register the product. With that in mind we came up with a warranty reminder that is meant for any individual who buy any kind of product that comes with a warranty from a manufacturer/retailer and willing to save money by putting in a little effort by registering the products they buy so they can be notified before the warranty expires and claim the warranty.</p>

    As a part of Savvy Coders boot camp's project on full stack web development, I did this web application Warranty Reminder. I am grateful to the whole Savvy Coders staff and my family without which this wouldn't have been possible.
